## Exercise on toDo List

## Description

This is an exercise I had to do for my MITxPRO course. I had to make a toDo list with seperate files following instructions and then add some style to the list. I also added a navigation bar with a dropdown for the regular weekly todos.

## How to run

Run an http server to load the files 

Load the URL in th browser


## Roadmap of future improvements 

I would like to add more style and a button that would make the item that I add either red or blue depending on its importance.
